# ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

Classifies images using a neural network with 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons. The neural network consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax.
